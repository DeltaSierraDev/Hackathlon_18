Task 1
Description

You're given an array A consisting of N positive integers. For each ordered pair (i, j) (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N, i != j),
if it is true that Ai & Aj = Aj (& is the binary and operation), then you should add a value (i - j)2 to the result
(the result is equal to 0 at the beginning). Since the final result can be very large, we're only interested in the result modulo 1 000 000 007.
Input

The first line of input contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200 000),
The second line contains N positive integers Ak (1 ≤ Ak ≤ 10 000).
Output

Print the result modulo 1 000 000 007.
Scoring

In test cases worth 40% of total points, N will be ≤ 1000.
In test cases worth additional 30% of total points, Ak will be ≤ 500.
Examples
Input
3
8 6 8
Output
8
Explanation: There are ordered pairs that meet the required condition: (1, 3) and (3, 1), so the final answer is (1 - 3)2 + (3 - 1)2 = 8.

Task 2
Description

Mirko is a teacher in a high school in Zagreb. In his class there are N students. Mirko knows that the sum of their heights is X (in cm).
Today, Mirko is measuring the students' height again, but one student is missing. You are given a list of N-1 students' heights.
Find the height of the missing student, assuming that none of the students' heights has changed.
Input
In the first line you are given natural numbers N and X separated with space (1 <= N <= 40), (100 <= X <= 10 000)
In the second line you are given N - 1 natural numbers separated by space, the heights of N-1 students, all numbers are in range [100, 250]
Output
In the first line of output write the missing student height! (It’s not possible to be negative or zero)

Task 3
Description

Slavko is writing an important document for his class tomorrow. His document consist of one long sentence,
containing only words of lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
Now he wants to format his sentence using one of three alignments that are supported by editor: left, right or center.
The editor displays each row of text with exactly W characters, which can either be a letter if it's a part of word, or space
(denoted with '.' - dot). Given the alignment that Mirko choose, the width of each row W, and the sentence, determine the look of the editor's display.
Input

The first line contains an integer W (15 ≤ W ≤ 100).
The second line contains a string that can either be "left", "right" or "center", denoting the alignment.
The third line contains the sentence consisting of 100 words max. You may assume each word can fit the width of the editor.
Output

Output the editor's display. Each row should consist of exactly W characters with blankspaces denoted with dots.
In the case when the text should be centered, and the blankspaces can't be divided evenly to both sides,
the right side should contain one dot more than the left side of the row.
Examples

Input
20 center quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Output


..quick.brown.fox...
jumps.over.the.lazy.
........dog.........

Input
15 right ping pong table tennis skiing bowling

Output


ping.pong.table
..tennis.skiing
........bowling

Task 4
Description

Mirko has N candies. He wants to divide them into smaller groups such that every group has at least one candy and the number of candies is equal in every group.
Example: Mirko has 6 candies. He can divide those candies in a total of 6 different ways:
1st way: 6 groups with 1 candy
2nd way: 3 groups with 2 candies
3rd way: 2 groups with 3 candies
4th way: 1 group with 6 candies
Write the total number of different ways of dividing candies to the output. The ways differ by the number of candies in each group.
Input
In the first line you are given the number N (1 <= N <= 1010)
Output
In the first line write the total number of ways described in the text
Scoring
In 20%: (1 <= N <= 10)
In next 20%: (1 <= N <= 1000)
In next 30%: (1 <= N <= 100 000)

Task 5
Description

Your task is to draw a tree. A tree consists of N levels of branches, the first level being the trunk which grows from the bottom up.
The length of all branches at the level k is equal to Ak units. At the point where a branch of level k (1 ≤ k < N) ends,
two new branches of level k+1 start to grow, each of them growing at the angle of 45 degrees from the parent branch
(one 45 degrees clockwise, and the other counter-clockwise from the parent branch).

To get a better idea about how the tree grows, look at the picture below which consist of 4 levels of branches the lengths of which are
4, 3, 2, 1, in that order. The numbers on the right picture indicate the level of the branch.
You may assume that there won't be two overlapping branches of the tree.

Input

The first line of input contains integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10), the number of levels of branches.
The second line of input contains N integers Ak (1 ≤ Ak ≤ 50), k-th number representing the length of the branches at level k.
Output

Your task is to print the matrix containing only characters '.' (dot) and '*' (asterisk),
Each part of each branch should be visible and denoted with an asterisk. There shouldn't be any empty borders (containing only dots).
Scoring

In tests worth 20% of total points, N = 2.
In tests worth 30% of total points, N = 3.
In tests worth 20% of total points, N = 4.

Task 6
Description

Mirko has a table of N rows (marked from 1 to N) and N columns (marked from 1 to N) of natural numbers. Slavko has Q sequential demands for Mirko.
In one demand Slavko gives Mirko some data - position (X,Y), length A and number K - and asks Mirko to rotate the square submatrix
whose upper-left corner is in (X,Y) - (row, column of table) and its length is A. Mirko must rotate the defined submatrix for K times for 90 degrees clockwise.
Mirko has done all of Slavko’s demands sequentially (from 1 to Q (inclusively)) and wrote the final table. Now Mirko can’t remember the original table.
You are given the final table and the list of Slavko’s demand (sequentially). Please find the original table!
Input
In the first line you are given the number N (1 <= N <= 50)
In the next N lines you are given N numbers - the final table (contains natural numbers in range [1, 100])
In the next line you are given the number Q (1 <= Q <= 50)
In the next Q lines you are given X Y A K (1 <= X, Y <= N, X + A - 1 <= N, Y + A - 1 <= N, K <= 1 000 000)
Output
In N lines of output write N natural numbers separated with spaces - Mirko’s initial table

Input

5 4 9
2
2 1 2 2
1 2 2 1


Output
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Explanation: Let's start with the initial table:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
After Slavko's first demand it becomes:
1 2 3
8 7 6
5 4 9
After Slavko's second demand it becomes:
1 7 2
8 6 4
5 4 9
Which is exactly same as the input table.
