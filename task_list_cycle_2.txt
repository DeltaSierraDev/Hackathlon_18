Task 1
Description

Mirko and Slavko live in a long street consisting of N houses (N is always an even number).
Each house is labeled with a house number ranging from 1 to N. Even numbers are located on one side,
and odd numbers are on the other side of the road (as shown on the picture below).

Help Mirko and determine the time required to get from his house
to Slavko’s house.

Input
The first line contains positive integers A and B (1 <= A, B <= 30), Mirko's and Slavko's house numbers.

Task 2
Description
Mirko and Slavko are playing their version of tennis. One set in a tennis match consists of several games.
You are given results of N sets played between Mirko and Slavko, formatted as X:Y,
where X represents the number of games won by Mirko and Y represents the number of games won by Slavko in one set.
The player with more games won wins the set. Determine the number of sets won by Mirko and Slavko!
Input
The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) - the number of sets played.
In the next N input lines you are given the set results, formatted as X:Y. X will always be different than Y. (1 <= X, Y <= 100)
Output
In the first line of output write the solution, formatted as A:B where A represents the number of sets won by Mirko
and B represents the number of sets won by Slavko. Note that A + B must be equal to N.

Task 3
Description

Mirko has recently started encrypting his devices with passwords. Mirko's brother Slavko found the whole thing really suspicious,
so he decided to install a keylogger on his laptop to find out his passwords and discover what Mirko is hiding.
A keylogger is a tool which registers each key pressed on keyboard and saves it to a log file.
Given the sequence of keys pressed by Mirko while entering his password, help Slavko solve the mystery and find out Mirko's password.
You may assume that Mirko uses only English letters, the caps-lock key and the backspace key,
and that his password consists of at least one character.
Input
The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200), the number of keys pressed by Mirko.
N lines follow, each of them containing the keys pressed by Mirko, formatted as follows:

* backspace if it's the backspace key,
* caps if it's the caps-lock key or
* a lowercase letter of the English alphabet.

Output
Print Mirko's password.

Task 4
Description

Bob is working as a stamp designer. Recently he drew 2 stamp designs on separate transparent papers.
Each stamp can be described as a sequence of colored rectangles. None of the rectangles of the same stamp overlap.
Unfortunately, he wasn't satisfied with the two designs, so he decided to merge them into one by placing the transparent paper
with the first design on top of the other paper. Determine the total colored area of the merged designs.
Input
The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), the number of rectangles of the first stamp. Then N lines follow,
each representing one rectangle on the first stamp described with four integers: X1, Y1, X2 and Y2 (0 ≤ X1 < X2 ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ Y1 < Y2 ≤ 10000).
(X1, Y1) is the bottom-left and (X2, Y2) is the top-right coordinate. The following line contains a positive integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 50),
the number of rectangles of the second stamp. Then M lines follow, each containing four integers X1, Y1, X2 and Y2
(0 ≤ X1 < X2 ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ Y1 < Y2 ≤ 10000). (X1, Y1) is the bottom-left and (X2, Y2) is the top-right coordinate of the second stamp.
Output
Print the colored area after merging the 2 stamps.
Scoring
Test cases worth 20% of total points: N = M = 1.
Test cases worth additional 40% of total points: X1, Y1, X2, Y2 ≤ 30.

Explanation The first picture shows the first stamp, the second picture shows the second stamp and the third picture shows the merged stamps.
The total area filled with colors on the merged stamps is 24.

Task 5
Description

You're given a chessboard consisting of N rows and N columns. The rows and columns are labeled with numbers from 1 to N.
You're also given K figures and their positions on the board. Each figure can be either a rook or a bishop.
Find the area of the largest piece of the board with unaffected cells.
Input
The first line contains positive integers N (1 <= N <= 15) and K (1 <= K <= 10), the numbers from the task description.
K lines follow, each formatted as: type_of_the_figure X Y where type_of_the_figure can be “rook” or “bishop”,
X is the row label and Y is the column label. You may assume that all of the figures are on different positions.
Output
Print the area of the largest poece of the board with unaffected cells.
Scoring
Test cases worth 20% of total points: K = 1 and only one rook figure.
Test cases worth additional 20% of total points: K = 1 and only one bishop figure.
Test cases worth additional 20% of total points: K <= 10 and only rook figures.
Test cases worth additional 20% of total points: K <= 10 and only bishop figures.
Example

Input:
8 1
rook 4 4

Output:
16

Explanation
The largest rectangle has corners at positions (5,5), (5, 8), (8, 5), (8,8)

Task 6
Description

Mirko and Slavko are playing a game. There is a sequence of N natural numbers in front of them. Mirko and Slavko are taking turns.
Mirko plays first. In each turn a player selects one of the numbers and divides it by one of its prime factors if it is possible.
The game is over when all of the numbers are equal to 1. The first player who can't make a move loses.
Determine the winner of the game and the total number of turns required to finish it.
Input
The first line contains a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the length of the array of numbers.
The second line contains N positive integers separated by space Ai (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000), the initial elements of the array.
Output
In the first line print the name of the winner, either Mirko or Slavko. In the second line print the required number of turns to finish the game.
Scoring
Test cases worth 20% of total points: N = 1, Ai ≤ 100.
Test cases worth additional 20% of total points: N = 1, Ai ≤ 1000000000. Test cases worth additional 30% of total points: N ≤ 100, Ai ≤ 100.
Example

Input:

15

Output:
Slavko
2

Explanation
In the first step Mirko can divide the number 15 by either 3 or 5. In both cases the resulting quotient will be a prime number,
so Slavko can divide it by itself and win.

Task 7
Description

You're given a picture constisting of N × M pixels which can be described as a matrix with N rows and M columns.
